# Deploying FCJ Management Application with Auto Scaling Group


#### Overview

In this exercise, we will deploy the application with an Auto Scaling Group to ensure the scalability of the application according to user needs. Additionally, we will implement a Load Balancer to distribute the load and manage user access requests to our Application Tier.

Make sure to review the [Deploying FCJ Management Application on a Windows/AmazonLinux Virtual Machine](https://000004.awsstudygroup.com/) document and understand how to deploy the application on the virtual machine. We will utilize the virtual machine deployed for **FCJ Management** for large-scale deployment and scaling within the Auto Scaling Group.
